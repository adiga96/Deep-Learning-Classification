# Classification of Shortages of PPE on Twitter using RNN & LSTM

In this project, we'll built an RNN-based learning model to classify different types of medical resource shortage using PyTorch and TorchText.

We have used:

pre-trained word embeddings
different RNN architecture
bidirectional RNN
multi-layer RNN
regularization
optimizer
